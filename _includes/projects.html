    <h3> Iris Species Web App </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Classification</li>
      <li> Visualization </li>
      <li> K-nearest neighbours</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R, this time I'm using it to develop an application that classifies a set of plants by Species : Setosa, Virginica, Versicolor. This is a simple project that ilustrates what we can do with the Rstudio tools.</p>

    <h3> The State of Data Science </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Data Exploration and Visualization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project is a Kaggle Kernel about the state of data science in 2017 according to a industry-wide survey Kaggle conducted this year, the survey received over 16000 responses from people around the world. I want to show through a couple of visualizations things like where data scientists come from or what tools they are using, also I want to describe the profile of who is working with data. </p>
