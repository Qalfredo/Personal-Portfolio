title: 'Testing Classification Algorithm Shiny app'
---
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. In this little project I developed a very simple app as a part of the [Developing Data Products](https://es.coursera.org/learn/data-products) Course. Basically the app tests the K-nearest neighbours algorithm over Iris data. The visualizations were made using the [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) library.
