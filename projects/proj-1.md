title: 'Testing Classification Algorithm Shiny app'
---
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. In this little project I developed a very simple app as a part of the Developing Data Products Course. Basically the app tests the K-nearest neighbours algorithm over Iris data. The visualizations were made using the Plotly library.
